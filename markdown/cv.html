            <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
            <p><strong>15+ years</strong> of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving <strong>complex problems</strong> in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions, and research labs. Driven <strong>self-starter</strong> and <strong>fast learner</strong>, always supporting my development teams with <strong>top-notch coding skills</strong>. I enjoy the challenge to maintain <strong>team cooperation</strong> to achieve objectives/deliveries in the process development. I strongly believe that <strong>sharing knowledge</strong> is a key point in a dev team, and I do my best to write clear and good code and implement best practices.</p>
