About me

15+ years of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on
experience solving complex problems in software development using
several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies,
including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions,
and research labs. Driven self-starter and fast learner, always
supporting my development teams with top-notch coding skills. I enjoy
the challenge to maintain team cooperation to achieve
objectives/deliveries in the process development. I strongly believe
that sharing knowledge is a key point in a dev team, and I do my best to
write clear and good code and implement best practices.

Experience

Engineering Manager — Talkdesk, 2022 - Present

Management of the HLS - Healthcare & Life Science stream and Support
stream at Industries BU. (manager of 10+ Individual Contributors from
entry levels to leads)

The HLS stream is responsible for Healthcare Experience Cloud
development, integrating healthcare call centers with unified patient
information.

The Support stream teams are composed of two squads. The Cross
Industries team implements tools and integrations to be used in other
projects in our BU. The QA team provides a framework and procedure to
validate the quality of our products.

Achievements / Tasks:

-   Release of Agent Flows project (integration between EDP, Talkdesk
    and Zingtree) in Summer’22 release in 7 months (team creation,
    backlog organization and implementation);
-   Restructure the QA implementation process, providing some guidance
    how support the teams and organizing the backlog;
-   Define and implement the 1:1 weekly meetings and growth plans for
    each Indivudual Contributors and promote the link between each IC to
    the Talkdesk V2M2 (Vision, Value, Method and Metrics).

Senior Software Engineer — Talkdesk, 2021 - 2022

Integrate a new team from the ground to create a new solution for
banking financial services.

The tech stack in this project uses Kotlin (BE), SpringBoot, React (FE),
Redis, PostGres SQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ.

Achievements / Tasks:

-   Release the first verion of Visual IVR for Financial Services in the
    Summer release;
-   Created a in-house solution for Visua IVR Frontend;
-   Present some technical sessions to present new technologies
    (Functional Programming, K6).

Senior Software Engineer — Capgemini Portugal [ASML Project], 2018 - 2021

Responsible to start the ASML project, where I contributed in Variant
Pattern implementation at the robot component to be used in next
lithography machine generation (EXE-5000), and currently I’m leading the
Portugal team to expand unit tests quality using a framework based on
gtest. I was one of the founders in the Meetup internal group in Altran
PT.

Achievements / Tasks:

-   Delivered first version for RYUN (Universal Pick and Place Robot)
    component, with all features planned for this version;
-   Added unit tests for RYUN component with 100% of code coverage;
-   Contributed with the RYAU component migration to legacy version;
-   Generated an investigation for RYAU autotesters, where I found 65%
    fake tests (tests without implementation);
-   Achieved with success the first phase for UTTK to ATTEST migration
    (around 400 tests in 10 weeks).

IT Manager — Technomar Engineering, 2016 - 2018

Managed the team responsible to implement new features in the TMS
(Technomar Maritime Simulator). TMS is a vessel maneuver simulator used
in training activities. Launched the certification planning for TMS
simulator by DNV GL agency, and the collaborated in the the core of
hydrodynamic numerical model applied in a “full bridge” simulator.
Cultivated good practices in software development process, such as
Scrum/Kanban board, TDD, Git adoption and mentored meeting sessions to
promote the homogenization of the knowledge of the team.

Achievements / Tasks:

-   Enhanced in communication channel using the phonon framework, with
    gains in 15% speedup and improve the code maintainability;
-   Redesigned the database in MongoDB, with a definition of a schema to
    be use in DB, and implemented a unified access library to access the
    data;
-   Orchestrated the full delivery of new simulation station at
    Technomar office, providing a simulator with 360 degrees immersion.
-   Instituted Gitlab as tool to obtain code metrics, and manage the
    bugs, new features, backlog and milestone control for the team and
    the founders.

Researcher / HPC Software Engineer — Numerical Offshore Tank, 2008 - 2016

My role in the TPN laboratory was to develop a set of applications with
High-Performance Computing. The languages I use was C++/C, Python,
MPI/sockets and bash in Linux and Windows environment. Other duties
includes testing and validation of numerical simulations, optimization,
implementation of parallel improvements and integration with other
projects. I also worked in others several projects, including the first
version of vessel maneuver simulator called SMH. This project was select
as finalist of ANP (National Petroleum Agency) Prize Award for
Technological Innovation in 2016.

Achievements / Tasks:

-   Optimized parallel execution of the numerical solver in the cluster
    environment saving around 35% in resources using my Ph.D. research;
-   Minimized around 10% the time execution in the standalone version of
    the numerical solver using OpenMP;
-   Reduced in order to 60% the storage space with the output results of
    the application using a binary format;
-   Championed and implemented a cross compilation in Windows and Linux
    environment with CMake;
-   Introduced a MPI communication instead pure socket, providing more
    robustness in the communication channel;
-   Championed the use of tests in development flow to increase the
    development quality;
-   Built an initial CI with (CDash and CTest) to check the repository
    integrity.
