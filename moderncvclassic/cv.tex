\section{About me}

With over \textbf{16+ years} of experience in software development, I've
evolved from a proficient Software Engineer into an accomplished
\textbf{Engineering Manager}. My journey has encompassed a wide array of
projects and industries, from startups to oil and gas companies,
educational institutions, and research labs.

\vspace{1em}
As a \textbf{self-driven}, \textbf{quick learner}, and \textbf{top-notch
coder}, I've always been at the forefront of \textbf{solving complex
problems} and supporting my \textbf{development teams}. This journey
culminated in my transition to an Engineering Manager role.

\vspace{1em}
In this capacity, I thrive on maintaining \textbf{team collaboration} to
achieve project objectives. I firmly believe in the importance of
\textbf{knowledge sharing} and consistently promote \textbf{clear},
\textbf{high-quality coding} and \textbf{best practices}. My
transformation reflects my passion for talent development, driving
impactful projects, and contributing to organizational success at the
intersection of technology and engineering.

\section{Experience}


\cventry{2021 - Present}{}{}{}{}{As the Engineering Manager at Industries BU, I have overseen a %
comprehensive portfolio, which includes \textbf{Healthcare Experience %
Cloud (HEC)}, \textbf{Automated Notifications (AN)}, and \textbf{Agent %
Flows (AF)} products, along with the dedicated \textbf{QA} team. In this %
capacity, I've had the privilege of leading and mentoring a team of %
\textbf{13+ Individual Contributors}, ranging from entry-level %
professionals to team leads. %
 %
I've not only managed these \textbf{critical products} and teams but %
also \textbf{championed} a culture of innovation, %
\textbf{collaboration}, and \textbf{continuous improvement}. My role has %
been integral in driving our organization's commitment to delivering %
\textbf{high-quality} solutions and \textbf{fostering} a dynamic and %
\textbf{forward-thinking} work environment. %
}

\cventry{2021 - 2022}{}{}{}{}{Integrate a new team from the ground to create a new solution for %
banking financial services. %
 %
The tech stack in this project uses \textbf{Kotlin (BE)}, %
\textbf{SpringBoot}, \textbf{React (FE)}, \textbf{Redis}, %
\textbf{PostGres SQL}, \textbf{MongoDB}, \textbf{RabbitMQ}. %
}

\cventry{2018 - 2021}{}{}{}{}{Responsible to start the \textbf{ASML} project, where I contributed in %
\textbf{Variant Pattern} implementation at the robot component to be %
used in next lithography machine generation (EXE-5000), and currently %
I'm leading the Portugal team to expand unit tests quality using a %
framework based on \textbf{gtest}. I was one of the founders in the %
Meetup internal group in Altran PT. %
}

\cventry{2016 - 2018}{}{}{}{}{\textbf{Managed} the team responsible to implement new features in the %
\textbf{TMS (Technomar Maritime Simulator)}. \textbf{TMS} is a vessel %
maneuver simulator used in training activities. \textbf{Launched} the %
certification planning for \textbf{TMS} simulator by %
\href{https://www.dnvgl.com/}{DNV GL agency}, and the %
\textbf{collaborated} in the the core of hydrodynamic numerical model %
applied in a ``full bridge'' simulator. \textbf{Cultivated} good %
practices in software development process, such as \textbf{Scrum/Kanban} %
board, \textbf{TDD}, \textbf{Git} adoption and \textbf{mentored} meeting %
sessions to promote the homogenization of the knowledge of the team. %
}

\cventry{2008 - 2016}{}{}{}{}{My role in the TPN laboratory was to develop a set of applications with %
\textbf{High-Performance Computing}. The languages I use was %
\textbf{C++/C}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{MPI/sockets} and \textbf{bash} %
in Linux and Windows environment. Other duties includes testing and %
validation of numerical simulations, optimization, implementation of %
parallel improvements and integration with other projects. I also worked %
in others several projects, including the first version of %
\textbf{vessel maneuver simulator} called \textbf{SMH}. This project was %
select as finalist of \textbf{ANP (National Petroleum Agency)} %
