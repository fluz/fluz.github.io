\section{About me}

With over \textbf{16+ years} of experience in software development, I've
evolved from a proficient Software Engineer into an accomplished
\textbf{Engineering Manager}. My journey has encompassed a wide array of
projects and industries, from startups to oil and gas companies,
educational institutions, and research labs.

\vspace{1em}
As a \textbf{self-driven}, \textbf{quick learner}, and \textbf{top-notch
coder}, I firmly believe in the importance of \textbf{knowledge sharing}
and consistently promote \textbf{clear}, \textbf{high-quality coding},
and \textbf{best practices}. My transition to the Engineering Manager
role reflects my passion for \textbf{talent development}, driving
\textbf{impactful projects}, and contributing to \textbf{organizational
success} at the intersection of technology and engineering.

\section{Experience}


\cventry{2022 - Present}{}{}{}{}{I've overseen a broad portfolio, including products like %
\textbf{Healthcare Experience Cloud}, \textbf{Automated Notifications}, %
and \textbf{Agent Flows}, along with the \textbf{QA team}. I've had the %
privilege of leading and mentoring a team of \textbf{10+ Individual %
Contributors}, ranging from entry-level professionals to team leads. %
}

\cventry{2021 - 2022}{}{}{}{}{Integrated a new team from the ground up to create a new solution for %

\textbf{SpringBoot}, \textbf{React}, \textbf{Redis}, \textbf{PostGres %
SQL}, \textbf{MongoDB}, and \textbf{RabbitMQ}. %
}

\cventry{2018 - 2021}{}{}{}{}{Started the \textbf{ASML} project, where I contributed to the new %
lithography machine generation project. I led the Portugal team to %
expand unit test implementation with a framework based on \textbf{gtest} %
and implemented the \textbf{Variant Pattern} in a robot component. I %
also was one of the founders of the Meetup internal group in Altran PT. %
}

\cventry{2016 - 2018}{}{}{}{}{I led a team in charge of implementing new features for the %
\textbf{Technomar Maritime Simulator} used in training activities. I %
initiated the certification plan with \href{https://www.dnvgl.com/}{DNV %
GL agency} and contributed to the core of the hydrodynamic numerical %
model. Additionally, I fostered best practices in software development, %
including the use of \textbf{Scrum}, \textbf{Test-Driven Development}, %
\textbf{Git}, and conducted mentoring sessions to enhance team %
knowledge. %
}

\cventry{2008 - 2016}{}{}{}{}{In the TPN laboratory, I developed \textbf{High-Performance Computing} %
applications using \textbf{C++/C}, \textbf{Python}, %
\textbf{MPI/sockets}, and \textbf{bash} in Linux and Windows. I also %
handled testing, optimization, parallel improvements, and integration %
with other projects. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of %
\textbf{SMH}, a finalist for the %
\href{http://www.anp.gov.br/pesquisa-desenvolvimento-inovacao/302-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica/edicoes-anteriores/888-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica-2016}{2016 %
