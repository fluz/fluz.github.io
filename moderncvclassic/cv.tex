\section{About me}

\textbf{15+ years} of developing and working in projects led me to have
hands-on experience solving \textbf{complex problems} in software
development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range
of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational
institutions, and research labs. Driven \textbf{self-starter} and
\textbf{fast learner}, always supporting my development teams with
\textbf{top-notch coding skills}. I enjoy the challenge to maintain
\textbf{team cooperation} to achieve objectives/deliveries in the
process development. I strongly believe that \textbf{sharing knowledge}
is a key point in a dev team, and I do my best to write clear and good
code and implement best practices.

\section{Experience}


\cventry{2022 - Present}{}{}{}{}{Management of the \textbf{HLS --- Healthcare \& Life Science stream} and %
\textbf{Support stream} at Industries BU. (manager of \textbf{10+} %
Individual Contributors from entry levels to leads) %
 %
The HLS stream is responsible for \textbf{Healthcare Experience Cloud} %
development, integrating healthcare call centers with unified patient %
information. %
 %
The Support stream teams are composed of two squads. The \textbf{Cross %
Industries} team implements tools and integrations to be used in other %
projects in our BU. The \textbf{QA team} provides a framework and %
procedure to validate the quality of our products. %
}

\cventry{2021 - 2022}{}{}{}{}{Integrate a new team from the ground to create a new solution for %
banking financial services. %
 %
The tech stack in this project uses \textbf{Kotlin (BE)}, %
\textbf{SpringBoot}, \textbf{React (FE)}, \textbf{Redis}, %
\textbf{PostGres SQL}, \textbf{MongoDB}, \textbf{RabbitMQ}. %
}

\cventry{2018 - 2021}{}{}{}{}{Responsible to start the \textbf{ASML} project, where I contributed in %
\textbf{Variant Pattern} implementation at the robot component to be %
used in next lithography machine generation (EXE-5000), and currently %
I'm leading the Portugal team to expand unit tests quality using a %
framework based on \textbf{gtest}. I was one of the founders in the %
Meetup internal group in Altran PT. %
}

\cventry{2016 - 2018}{}{}{}{}{\textbf{Managed} the team responsible to implement new features in the %
\textbf{TMS (Technomar Maritime Simulator)}. \textbf{TMS} is a vessel %
maneuver simulator used in training activities. \textbf{Launched} the %
certification planning for \textbf{TMS} simulator by %
\href{https://www.dnvgl.com/}{DNV GL agency}, and the %
\textbf{collaborated} in the the core of hydrodynamic numerical model %
applied in a ``full bridge'' simulator. \textbf{Cultivated} good %
practices in software development process, such as \textbf{Scrum/Kanban} %
board, \textbf{TDD}, \textbf{Git} adoption and \textbf{mentored} meeting %
sessions to promote the homogenization of the knowledge of the team. %
}

\cventry{2008 - 2016}{}{}{}{}{My role in the TPN laboratory was to develop a set of applications with %
\textbf{High-Performance Computing}. The languages I use was %
\textbf{C++/C}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{MPI/sockets} and \textbf{bash} %
in Linux and Windows environment. Other duties includes testing and %
validation of numerical simulations, optimization, implementation of %
parallel improvements and integration with other projects. I also worked %
in others several projects, including the first version of %
\textbf{vessel maneuver simulator} called \textbf{SMH}. This project was %
select as finalist of \textbf{ANP (National Petroleum Agency)} %
